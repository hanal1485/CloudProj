<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the history of art, there are a lot of 
incredible painters. But there are some who stand just a hair above the rest and 
have created a lasting legacy that endures well beyond their lifetime. Not only 
are they technically skilled, but these artists have all made important 
contributions that have changed Western culture. Many of these artists were 
considered avant-garde because they pushed boundaries and made startling 
innovations. Most were already considered geniuses during their lifetimes and 
enjoyed unparalleled success, while others weren't acknowledged until after 
their death.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath 
of the High Renaissance who is widely considered one of the most diversely 
talented individuals ever to have lived.While his fame initially rested on his 
achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he 
made drawings and notes on science and invention; these involve a variety of 
subjects including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and 
paleontology Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist idea, and his 
collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled 
only by that of his contemporary Michelangelo.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonardo was born out of wedlock to a notary, Piero da Vinci, 
and a peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci, in the region of Florence, Italy. 
Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Italian painter Andrea del 
Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of 
Ludovico il Moro in Milan, and he later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice. He 
spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he had no formal academic training, many historians 
and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; or 
&quot;Universal Genius&quot;, an individual of &quot;unquenchable curiosity&quot; and &quot;feverishly 
inventive imagination.&quot; According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and 
depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and &quot;his mind 
and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and 
remote.&quot; Scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, 
though the empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonardo is widely considered one of the greatest painters of 
all time. Mona Lisa is the most famous of his works and the most famous portrait 
ever made. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time 
and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, 
Salvator Mundi was sold at auction for $450.3 million, setting a new record for 
most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonardo is also revered for his technological ingenuity. He 
conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle, concentrated 
solar power, an adding machine, and the double hull. Relatively few of his 
designs were constructed or even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern 
scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy 
during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the 
world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a 
machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. He is also sometimes credited 
with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter, and tank. He made substantial 
discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, geology, optics, tribology, and 
hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no 
direct influence on subsequent science</font>.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelangelo di Lodovico 
Buonarroti Simoni known simply as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, 
painter, architect and poet of the High Renaissance born in the Republic of 
Florence, who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western 
art. His artistic versatility was of such a high order that he is often 
considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man. Several 
scholars have described Michelangelo as the greatest artist of his age and even 
as the greatest artist of all time.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of Michelangelo's 
works of painting, sculpture and architecture rank among the most famous in 
existence. His output in these fields was prodigious; given the sheer volume of 
surviving correspondence, sketches and reminiscences, he is the best-documented 
artist of the 16th century. He sculpted two of his best-known works, the Pietà 
and David, before the age of thirty. Despite holding a low opinion of painting, 
he also created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western 
art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and 
The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library 
pioneered Mannerist architecture. At the age of 74, he succeeded Antonio da 
Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. He transformed 
the plan so that the western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, 
with some modification, after his death.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelangelo was the first 
Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. In fact, two 
biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, 
proposed that Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, 
and was &quot;supreme in not one art alone but in all three&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino 
(&quot;the divine one&quot;). His contemporaries often admired his terribilità—his ability 
to instil a sense of awe. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate 
Michelangelo's impassioned, highly personal style resulted in Mannerism, the 
next major movement in Western art after the High Renaissance.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Lifespan: </b>July 15, 1606 – October 4, 1669</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn 
was a Dutch draughtsman, painter, and printmaker. An innovative and prolific 
master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual 
artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. 
Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide 
range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to 
landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, and biblical and 
mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art came in 
a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch 
Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), although in many ways 
antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific 
and innovative and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the 
Dutch Golden Age, such as Jan Vermeer of Delft, Rembrandt was also an avid art 
collector and dealer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rembrandt never went abroad, but he was considerably 
influenced by the work of the Italian masters and Netherlandish artists who had 
studied in Italy, like Pieter Lastman, the Utrecht Caravaggists, Flemish 
Baroque, and Peter Paul Rubens. After he achieved youthful success as a portrait 
painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial 
hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, 
his reputation as an artist remained high, and for twenty years he taught many 
important Dutch painters.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits 
and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative 
triumphs. His self-portraits form a unique and intimate autobiography, in which 
the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity. 
Rembrandt's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his 
transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive 
technique into a true art form, along with Jacques Callot. His reputation as the 
greatest etcher in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime and 
never questioned since. Few of his paintings left the Dutch Republic while he 
lived, but his prints were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider 
reputation was initially based on them alone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his works he exhibited knowledge of classical iconography, 
which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the 
depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the 
specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations 
of Amsterdam's Jewish population. Because of his empathy for the human 
condition, he has been called &quot;one of the great prophets of civilization&quot;. The 
French sculptor Auguste Rodin said, &quot;Compare me with Rembrandt! What sacrilege! 
With Rembrandt, the colossus of Art! We should prostrate ourselves before 
Rembrandt and never compare anyone with him!&quot;</font></p>
